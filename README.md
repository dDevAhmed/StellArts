## 🚀 Overview

In many regions, finding reliable artisans (plumbers, electricians, carpenters) relies heavily on word-of-mouth, leading to limited visibility for workers and lack of trust for clients.

**StellArts** solves this by offering:
- **For Clients**: Easy discovery of verified artisans, transparent reviews, and secure escrow payments.
- **For Artisans**: Broader market access, fair compensation, and a reputation system that they own.

Our vision is to become the trusted decentralized infrastructure for the gig economy, promoting financial inclusion through Stellar's low-cost, high-speed network.

## 🛠️ Core Features

### 🔎 Discovery & Matching
- **Geolocation-Based**: Uber-like proximity matching to find the nearest available artisan.
- **Rich Profiles**: Verified skills, work history, and real-time availability.

### 💳 Secure & Efficient Payments
- **Escrow Smart Contracts**: Funds are locked exclusively until job completion is confirmed, eliminating fraud.
- **Stellar-Powered**: 
    - **Low Fees**: Transactions cost < $0.01 (micropayment friendly).
    - **Fast Settlement**: Payments settle in 3-5 seconds.
    - **Multi-Currency**: Support for USDC and local assets.

### ⭐ Trust & Reputation

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the development environment.

### Prerequisites
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (for Backend)
- **Node.js 18+** (for Frontend)
- **Rust & Soroban CLI** (for Smart Contracts)

### Backend (FastAPI)

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration if needed
   ```
3. Start the services:
   ```bash
   make up
   # Or: docker-compose up -d
   ```
   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`. Interact with the docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### Frontend (Next.js)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # We use --ignore-scripts to bypass broken third-party post-install scripts
   npm install --ignore-scripts
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### Smart Contracts (Soroban)

For detailed contract development, see [contracts/README.md](./contracts/README.md).

```bash
cd contracts
cargo test
```

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 13 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI.
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python 3.11, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, Redis.
- **Blockchain**: Stellar Network, Soroban Smart Contracts (Rust).
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, GitHub Actions, AWS (planned).

## 🔐 Smart Contracts

We use **Soroban** to handle trustless logic:
- **Escrow**: Locks funds and handles release/refunds based on job status.
- **Reputation**: Stores rating hashes and scores to prevent manipulation.

> See [contracts/README.md](./contracts/README.md) for deployment and invocation guides.
